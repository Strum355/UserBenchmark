# UserBenchmark Android App

Use [userbenchmark.com](http://userbenchmark.com) a lot? Tired of it not being mobile friendly? Then this is the app for you! 

@ userbenchmark creators: if you have any comments, concerns, questions etc, please get in contact with me. I will gladly answer/comply/whatever. You can find me on Twitter under the same username, Strum355

Works alongside [Userbenchmark Scraper](https://github.com/Strum355/UserBenchmark-Scraper)  

While this is Open Source, I rely on your kindness not to steal the code and upload copies of it to the Google Play Store. Be kind, be wise!

Yes I know, everything looks terrible right now. Focusing on getting all data working and in the right place first before I make it look fantastic
